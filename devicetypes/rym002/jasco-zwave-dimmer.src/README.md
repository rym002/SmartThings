* Single, double, triple click, Hold, and Release CentralSceneNotification using a child button to enable additional automations.  
  **Note:** Button release action is presented as 6x because there is no release member for supportedButtonValues

**Additional**
* Will need to replace namespace in ```createChildButton``` with your own.
